Home Climate Control Android Open Accessory: Android APIs

The [Home Climate Control Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sf.dz4.android.remote) is a part of [DIY Zoning Project](https://github.com/home-climate-control/dz) Android family (another part is the [HCC Accessory Driver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sf.dz4.adk), the complement to [the Arduino firmware](https://github.com/home-climate-control/arduino)). There are also [other parts](http://www.homeclimatecontrol.com/overseer), not currently published.

The moment this ecosystem becomes mature enough to be opened, the set of APIs and client libraries sufficient for integration with it will be published here.
